## How to run:
1. cd to directory where docker-compose.yml resides
2. Pull and run the image 
     ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
3. Go to localhost:8080/apidocs
4. Click try it out button, then execute 

## TODOS:
- folder output content should be fetched from model-training somehow.
- docker-compose should not be in this repo but in operations. 
- Workflow does not work.
